// often don't run JavaScript. So every page's tags live here once and are used twice:
//  - vite.config.ts writes one HTML file per page at build time (games.html, docs.html ...), which
//    nginx serves for that address, so a shared link shows the right preview;
//  - setSeo() keeps the tags right while someone moves around the app without a reload.
// Keep the paths in step with main.tsx and nginx.conf.
